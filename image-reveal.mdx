## Introduction

Today, we will be creating the following image reveal effect using Framer Motion and React. It's relatively simple to set up and won't take too much time.

Typically, using such animations is far more common when using vanilla JavaScript and GSAP. GSAP is preferable for more complex and flexible animations, but required more manual setup to configure properly, and was a bit awkward to use with React in some use cases.
In comparison, Framer Motion was built for React, and I personally found that it integrates far easier than other animation libraries while giving us access to powerful effects.

When trying to learn Framer motion however, I found that there weren't many community resources on recreating popular animation effects, and created this blog in hopes that someone trying to learn Framer Motion like I was not long ago will find this useful.

## Project Setup

First, let's create our React app.

```
npx create-react-app image-reveal

Next, let's install Framer Motion and import some libraries we will need for the
project.

```
npm install framer-motion
```

Then import motion from Framer Motion into your App.js file

` ` `
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'
` ` `
